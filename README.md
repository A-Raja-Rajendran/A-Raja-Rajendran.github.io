## About:
This webpage asks the user to select a number between 1 to 99. Each number corresponds to a symbol. The user then has to perform a small calculation and remember the symbol assigned to the number which the calculation resulted in. On clicking 'click here', a popup appears which will show the exact symbol which the user has in mind.

## Symbols:
A total of 20 symbols have been used which is assigned to the numbers randomly whenever the user refreshes. symbols are a combination of normal ASCII characters (not alphanumeric) which is supported by every browser.

## Working:
Based on a very basic math principle.
